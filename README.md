# liltcp
A very minimal program to make a single Tcpconnection in either client mode (default) or server mode (with flag `-s`).
Once connected, stdin gets sent into the socket.

Read bytes are printed to stdout. The user can input and view bytes in any format including UTF-8, hexadecimal and base 64.
